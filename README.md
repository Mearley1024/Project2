# Project2

**OBJECTIVE:**
The goal of this application is to match a user to a recommended plant based on their personality.

**MISSION STATEMENT:**
At MyPetPlant we know that caring for an animal isn't in everybody's schedule. That's why we developed a system for matching you with a great plant that fits into your schedule and enviornment. Now anyone can feel the satisfaction of caring and nurturing a living thing!



**INSTRUCTIONS:**

  1) The home page shows a jumbotron ("large block") with the title of the webpage "myPetPlant" to the left and a image "carousel" in the center and a login button on the far right. 
  Below this, we see the "mission statement", and a "take survey" button. 

  2) In order to create a user we click once on the "survey" button where this action routes us to the user page and we are asked to create a user account and fill out a "personality questionnaire" to find the best plant match. 

  3) click "submit" button, this will route us to the results page.
  
  4) On the results/match page the user will see the image of their recommended plant along with useful facts they will need to care for it.

  5) Once the user is created and there is a plantMatch a database will store the profile so they can log in and chack on their plant.
